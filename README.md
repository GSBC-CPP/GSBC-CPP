# GSBC-CPP

http://gsbc-cpp.github.io/GSBC-CPP/

Make changes to the website under the master branch. Merging gh-pages with master pushes all changes into the website.

TODO:
 - create a biography page
 - integrate WordPress into the site
 - add pictures (some kind of slideshow) into the main page and possibly add another page for more pictures
 - add links to the GSBC site, Facebook group, other social media pages, etc.
 - contact information
 - come up with more ideas to put on this TODO list
