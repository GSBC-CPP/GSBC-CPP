http://gsbc-cpp.github.io/GSBC-CPP/

Make changes to the website under the master branch. Merging gh-pages with master pushes all changes into the website.

TODO:
 - creat an "About Us" page
 - create a biography page (merge with "About Us"?)
 - integrate WordPress into the site (extract latest posts with jQuery)
 - add another page for more pictures
 - come up with more ideas to put on this TODO list
